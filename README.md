# Welcome, traveler!
My name's Daniel, but you can call me Dan. Welcome to my GitHub! I am a high school student in southern Pennsylvania who loves to make people's lives better with my creations. I am the creator and maintainer of Admin, the Discord bot designed with teachers and school clubs in mind. Feel free to browse around!
